# Lua Skill Developer Manual

[Documentation hub](index.md) | [Chinese manual](zh-CN/skill-development.md)

## 1. Purpose

This manual is for **Lua Skill authors**. It documents the `vulcan.*` capability surface that the current runtime actually injects into Lua, including:

- Which `vulcan.*` APIs are available.
- How each API is called.
- Which APIs are always available and which ones depend on host or current-skill binding state.
- Which fields are implementation details and should not be treated as long-term public contracts by skills.

This document follows the current implementation, especially the Lua injection logic in `src/runtime/engine.rs`.

## 2. Quick Summary

The current skill runtime exposes these top-level capabilities:

- `vulcan.call`
- `vulcan.runtime.*`
- `vulcan.fs.*`
- `vulcan.path.*`
- `vulcan.process.*`
- `vulcan.os.*`
- `vulcan.json.*`
- `vulcan.cache.*`
- `vulcan.host.*`
- `vulcan.context.*`
- `vulcan.deps.*`
- `vulcan.sqlite.*`
- `vulcan.lancedb.*`

Three important facts:

1. The runtime currently treats skills as **trusted code** by default and does not provide a sandbox security promise.
2. Some values under `vulcan.context.*`, `vulcan.deps.*`, `vulcan.sqlite.*`, and `vulcan.lancedb.*` depend on host injection or current-skill binding state. Do not assume they are always valid.
3. Hosts can force-skip skills through `LuaRuntimeHostOptions.ignored_skill_ids`. Ignored skills do not prepare dependencies, bind databases, or register entries.

## 2.1 Skill Naming And Release Package Rules

`skill_id` is the stable primary key shared by the LuaSkills runtime, lifecycle management, config namespaces, dependency folders, database bindings, and canonical entry names. The current rule is "the directory name is the `skill_id`"; `skill_id` is not declared by a field in `skill.yaml`.

`skill_id` and every `entry.name` must use the same identifier format:

```text
^[a-z]([a-z0-9-]*[a-z0-9])?$
```

Meaning:

- Start with a lowercase ASCII letter.
- Continue only with lowercase ASCII letters, digits, and hyphens `-`.
- Do not start with a digit, use uppercase letters or underscores, or end with a hyphen.
- Valid examples: `vulcan-codekit`, `codekit2`, `vulcan-runtime-tools`.
- Invalid examples: `2codekit`, `Vulcan-codekit`, `vulcan_codekit`, `vulcan-codekit-`.

Skill package layout rules:

- The physical directory name is the final `skill_id`. For example, `skills/vulcan-codekit/` has `skill_id = vulcan-codekit`.
- `skill.yaml` must not declare a `skill_id` field. The runtime rejects a skill that declares it.
- `skill.yaml` `name` is human-readable metadata and does not participate in `skill_id` matching.
- Each `entries[].name` is a local entry name inside the current skill and must also satisfy the identifier rule above.
- Runtime canonical entry names are exposed as `{skill_id}-{entry_name}`. If a name conflicts with a host-reserved name or another entry, the runtime appends a stable numeric suffix, producing `{skill_id}-{entry_name}-{N}`.

GitHub-managed skill installs and release assets must use the same `skill_id`:

- If an install request does not pass an explicit `skill_id`, the runtime derives it from the GitHub repository name. It does not strip a `luaskills-` prefix automatically.
- The release zip file name must be `{skill_id}-v{version}-skill.zip`.
- The checksum file name must be `{skill_id}-v{version}-checksums.txt`.
- The zip must contain only one top-level directory named exactly `{skill_id}`, and it must contain `{skill_id}/skill.yaml`.
- Repository name, release asset prefix, checksum asset prefix, zip top-level directory, and final install directory should all use the same `skill_id`.

## 2.2 Entry Input Schema

LuaSkills now supports one full AI-facing object input schema per entry.

Recommended rule:

- Keep `skill.yaml` for human-friendly metadata such as `name`, `version`, `lua_entry`, and help links.
- Put complex tool input schemas in external JSON files under `schemas/`.
- Use `input_schema_file` when the schema contains nested objects, arrays with `items`, `oneOf` / `anyOf`, or strict `additionalProperties` rules.
- Keep legacy `parameters` only for backward compatibility or simple flat entries.

Current entry-schema fields:

- `parameters`: legacy flat parameter list. When `input_schema` and `input_schema_file` are both absent, the runtime projects `parameters` into one object schema automatically.
- `input_schema`: optional inline object schema inside `skill.yaml`.
- `input_schema_file`: optional relative JSON file path under `schemas/`. This is the recommended format for non-trivial schemas.

Rules:

- The final entry input schema must be one JSON object schema whose root `type` is `object`.
- `input_schema` and `input_schema_file` must not be declared together on the same entry.
- `input_schema_file` must stay under `schemas/` and must be one relative path.
- When `parameters` is empty but a full schema is present, LuaSkills derives one legacy top-level parameter preview from root `properties` for compatibility exports.

Example:

```yaml
entries:
  - name: node_source
    description: Read selected nodes.
    lua_entry: runtime/node_source.lua
    lua_module: demo.node_source
    input_schema_file: schemas/node_source.input.schema.json
```

```json
{
  "type": "object",
  "additionalProperties": false,
  "properties": {
    "nodes": {
      "type": "array",
      "items": {
        "type": "object",
        "properties": {
          "file": { "type": "string" },
          "structural_path": { "type": "string" }
        },
        "required": ["file", "structural_path"]
      }
    }
  },
  "required": ["nodes"]
}
```

## 2.3 Managed Identity Field Contract

Some skills need to bind multiple entry calls to the same session, task, or context state. LuaSkills reserves `LUASKILL_SID` as the standard managed identity field for skill entry arguments.

This is a LuaSkills ecosystem contract, not an MCP-specific convention. The runtime does not treat `LUASKILL_SID` as a magic field; skill code receives it as an ordinary string argument. Hosts and adapters that project LuaSkills entries into user-facing or model-facing tools are responsible for deciding whether the field is visible, hidden, or automatically injected.

Skill author rules:

- New skills that need a stable session, task, or context identity should use the entry argument name `LUASKILL_SID`.
- The field is only an identity handle for state continuity. Do not use it as an auth token, secret, database credential, or permission boundary.
- Skills must not assume every host can provide a managed identity. Help text should describe both managed and non-managed behavior.
- A stateful skill should provide a create, start, open, or bootstrap style entry when it can establish or resume state.
- If the caller explicitly passes `LUASKILL_SID`, the skill should reuse it instead of generating a new identity.
- If `LUASKILL_SID` is omitted and the skill supports non-managed fallback, the create/start/bootstrap entry may generate a new public identity.
- When a skill generates a public identity, the result must visibly return that identity and state that later calls should pass the same value.
- A skill may suggest saving a generated public identity into a host- or project-approved rules location, but it must not write that location without explicit user or host authorization.
- Non-create entries that require `LUASKILL_SID` should return a clear error when it is missing, including the expected create/start/bootstrap recovery path.

Host and adapter rules:

- When exposing entry schemas, scan for an input property named `LUASKILL_SID`.
- If the host has a stable managed identity for the current conversation, task, workspace, or equivalent context, it may hide `LUASKILL_SID` from the model/user-facing schema and remove it from the visible `required` list.
- Before invoking the entry in managed mode, the host must inject the hidden `LUASKILL_SID` into the argument object.
- When the host wants skills to detect and hide host-managed identities in tool results, it should inject the value with the reserved prefix `LUASKILLS-SID-`.
- The injected value must remain stable for the intended host scope and must not be freshly randomized on every call.
- If the host cannot provide a stable managed identity, it should leave `LUASKILL_SID` visible and let the caller or the skill fallback flow handle it.
- Managed-mode help should tell the model or user that the identity is injected by the host and should not be requested, printed, or saved.
- If a tool result includes the injected raw managed identity, the host should redact it or rewrite it into a managed-state note before returning it to the model/user.

These rules apply to every projection layer, including MCP, gRPC, FFI/SDK hosts, IDE integrations, and embedded product hosts.

## 3.1 Managed IO And Process Encoding

`vulcan.io` is the Rust-managed IO surface for AI-generated code, cross-platform file operations, and `luaexec` isolated execution. For Windows Unicode paths, explicit text decoding, and `io.popen` output handling, prefer `vulcan.io` over native `io` or `os`.

### 3.1.1 `vulcan.io.*` API Reference

| API | Parameters And Types | Return Value | Notes |
| --- | --- | --- | --- |
| `vulcan.io.open(path, mode?, options?)` | `path: string`; `mode?: string`, default `r`; `options?: string \| { encoding?: string }` | Managed file handle | Supports `r`, `w`, `a`, `rb`, `wb`, `ab`, `r+`, `w+`, `a+`, and binary/update combinations |
| `vulcan.io.read_text(path, options?)` | `path: string`; `options?: string \| { encoding?: string }` | `string` | Reads one whole text file |
| `vulcan.io.write_text(path, content, options?)` | `path: string`; `content: string`; `options?: string \| { encoding?: string }` | `true` | Overwrites one whole text file; does not create parent directories |
| `vulcan.io.append_text(path, content, options?)` | same as above | `true` | Appends text |
| `vulcan.io.lines(path, options?)` | `path: string`; `options?: string \| { encoding?: string }` | iterator function | Yields one line at a time and returns `nil` at EOF |
| `vulcan.io.popen(command, mode?, options?)` | `command: string`; `mode?: string`, default `r`; `options?: string \| { encoding?: string, timeout_ms?: integer }` | Managed file handle | Read mode only for now; write mode is not implemented |
| `vulcan.io.tmpfile()` | none | Managed file handle | Creates one temporary file that is removed on close |

### 3.1.2 Managed File Handle Methods

The handles returned by `vulcan.io.open(...)`, `vulcan.io.popen(...)`, and `vulcan.io.tmpfile()` support the same methods:

| Method | Parameters And Types | Return Value | Notes |
| --- | --- | --- | --- |
| `file:read(...)` | no args, `"*a"` / `"a"`, `"*l"` / `"l"`, or positive integer length | `string`, `nil`, or multiple values | Text mode returns decoded UTF-8 text; binary mode returns raw Lua byte strings |
| `file:write(...)` | one or more Lua scalar values | `true` | Text mode encodes text; binary mode writes raw bytes |
| `file:flush()` | none | `true` | Flushes pending writes |
| `file:close()` | none | `boolean` | Regular files usually return `true`; `popen` handles return child success |
| `file:seek(whence?, offset?)` | `whence?: "set" \| "cur" \| "end"`; `offset?: integer` | `integer` | Returns the new cursor offset |
| `file:lines()` | none | iterator function | Iterates from the current cursor until EOF |
| `file:setvbuf(...)` | any args | `true` | Compatibility no-op |

Extra rules:

- `file:read()` with no arguments reads one line without the trailing newline.
- `file:read(0)` returns an empty string, not `nil`.
- `file:read(n)` returns `nil` after EOF.
- `file:seek(...)` clamps beyond EOF to the buffer end and errors when moving before the start.
- In text mode, strings passed to `file:write(...)` must be valid UTF-8. Use binary mode or `vulcan.fs.read_bytes/write_bytes` when you need raw bytes.

### 3.1.3 Encoding Options

`options.encoding` or `encoding` currently supports:

| Value | Meaning |
| --- | --- |
| `utf-8` | Standard UTF-8 text |
| `system` | Host default text encoding; Windows ANSI code page on Windows |
| `oem` | Windows console OEM code page |
| `gbk` | GBK |
| `gb18030` | GB18030 |
| `latin1` | Latin-1 / ISO-8859-1 |
| `base64` | Byte-preserving Base64 text transport |

Default encoding selection:

- Use `LuaRuntimeHostOptions.default_text_encoding` when the host configured it.
- Otherwise use:
  - `system` on Windows
  - `utf-8` on other platforms

### 3.1.4 Managed `io.*` Compatibility Layer

Inside `vulcan.runtime.lua.exec(...)`, common `io.*` calls are redirected to the managed compatibility layer:

- `io.open`
- `io.input`
- `io.output`
- `io.read`
- `io.write`
- `io.flush`
- `io.close`
- `io.lines`
- `io.popen`
- `io.tmpfile`
- `io.type`

Important behavior:

- `io.input(path_or_file)` and `io.output(path_or_file)` can set default handles.
- When no explicit `io.output(...)` is configured, `io.write(...)` writes to runtime logging instead of silently disappearing.
- `io.close()` with no argument closes the current default output handle.
- `io.type(value)` returns `"file"`, `"closed file"`, or `"nil"`.
- Hosts can disable this replacement with `LuaRuntimeHostOptions.capabilities.enable_managed_io_compat = false`. `vulcan.io` itself still stays available.

### 3.1.5 Examples

Text read:

```lua
local text = vulcan.io.read_text("D:/data/example.txt", {
    encoding = "utf-8",
})

return text
```

Binary handle read:

```lua
local file = vulcan.io.open("D:/data/archive.bin", "rb")
local bytes = file:read("*a")
file:close()

return #bytes
```

Managed `popen`:

```lua
local file = vulcan.io.popen("cmd /C dir", "r", {
    encoding = "oem",
    timeout_ms = 3000,
})

local output = file:read("*a")
local ok = file:close()

return vulcan.json.encode({
    ok = ok,
    output = output,
})
```

## 3.2 Host-Forced Skill Ignore List

`ignored_skill_ids` is a host runtime policy used to skip selected skills early during load.

Typical scenarios:

- The host already provides a stronger native, gRPC, or VMM implementation.
- A default skill package overlaps with existing host functionality.
- A database-backed skill has been replaced by a host-side service, so SQLite or LanceDB binding should not start.

Matching rules:

- It matches the `skill_id` derived from the skill directory.
- It does not match `skill.yaml` `name`.
- It is not declared by the skill itself and is not part of dependency resolution.

Runtime effects:

- The whole skill is skipped when the ignore list matches.
- `dependencies.yaml` is not prepared.
- SQLite and LanceDB are not bound.
- No entries are registered.
- The skill does not appear in `list_entries` and cannot be called through `vulcan.call`.

This capability preserves the host and user's final choice. If users should still be able to use a skill, hosts should not add it to the ignore policy.

## 4. `vulcan.call`

### 4.1 Purpose

`vulcan.call(name, args)` lets one skill call another loaded skill entry.

- `name`: target entry canonical name.
- `args`: must be a Lua table.
- Return value: directly forwards the target skill's return values and supports multiple returns.

### 4.2 Minimal Example

```lua
local ok, result = pcall(vulcan.call, "demo-skill-run", {
    query = "hello",
    limit = 5,
})

if not ok then
    vulcan.runtime.log("warn", "call failed: " .. tostring(result))
    return nil
end

return result
```

### 4.3 Notes

- Missing entries raise an error directly.
- `args` must be a table, not a string or another scalar.
- `vulcan.call` inherits the current request context, budget snapshot, and tool config, then switches to the target skill's file context and database bindings.
- In `luaexec` scenarios, extra reentry protection prevents unbounded recursion back into the current runtime caller.

## 4.5 `vulcan.models.*`

`vulcan.models.*` is the fixed standard model capability surface for Lua skills.
It is not a generic host-tool call and does not let Lua choose provider configuration.

### 4.5.1 API Reference

| API | Parameters And Types | Return Value | Notes |
| --- | --- | --- | --- |
| `vulcan.models.status()` | none | `{ ok = true, capabilities = { embed = boolean, llm = boolean } }` | Always present; only reports whether the host registered each capability |
| `vulcan.models.has(capability)` | `capability: string` | `boolean` | Only recognizes `embed` and `llm` |
| `vulcan.models.embed(text)` | `text: string`, non-empty | success or failure envelope | Runs single-text embedding |
| `vulcan.models.llm(system, user)` | `system: string`, `user: string`, both non-empty | success or failure envelope | Runs one non-streaming LLM turn |

Minimal example:

```lua
if not vulcan.models.has("embed") then
    return {
        ok = false,
        reason = "model-embed-unavailable",
    }
end

local result = vulcan.models.embed("hello")
if not result.ok then
    return result
end

return result.vector
```

### 4.5.2 Result Shapes

`embed(...)` success envelope:

```lua
{
    ok = true,
    vector = { 0.1, 0.2, 0.3 },
    dimensions = 1536,
    usage = {
        input_tokens = 123,
    },
}
```

Field notes:

| Field | Type | Meaning |
| --- | --- | --- |
| `ok` | `boolean` | `true` on success |
| `vector` | `number[]` | embedding vector |
| `dimensions` | `integer` | vector dimension count |
| `usage` | `table?` | optional token-usage table from the host |
| `usage.input_tokens` | `integer?` | optional input token count |
| `usage.output_tokens` | `integer?` | optional output token count |

`llm(...)` success envelope:

```lua
{
    ok = true,
    assistant = "...",
    usage = {
        input_tokens = 123,
        output_tokens = 456,
    },
}
```

Field notes:

| Field | Type | Meaning |
| --- | --- | --- |
| `ok` | `boolean` | `true` on success |
| `assistant` | `string` | model response text |
| `usage` | `table?` | optional token-usage table |

Failure envelope:

```lua
{
    ok = false,
    error = {
        code = "provider_error",
        message = "model provider failed",
        provider_message = "raw provider error after host redaction",
        provider_code = "model_not_found",
        provider_status = 400,
    },
}
```

Error fields:

| Field | Type | Meaning |
| --- | --- | --- |
| `error.code` | `string` | stable error code |
| `error.message` | `string` | skill-facing error summary |
| `error.provider_message` | `string?` | provider message that the host chose to expose |
| `error.provider_code` | `string?` | provider-native error code |
| `error.provider_status` | `integer?` | provider status such as an HTTP status |

Current stable error codes:

- `model_unavailable`
- `invalid_argument`
- `provider_error`
- `timeout`
- `budget_exceeded`
- `internal_error`

### 4.5.3 Behavior Rules

- `status()` always exists and derives capability state from registered callbacks.
- `has()` only recognizes `embed` and `llm`. Unknown capabilities, wrong argument counts, or wrong types all return `false` instead of raising.
- `embed()` accepts exactly one non-empty string and does not support batch input.
- `llm()` accepts exactly two non-empty strings and does not support messages, tools, streaming, or thinking controls.
- `embed()` and `llm()` return failure envelopes for invalid arguments, missing capability registration, and provider failures instead of throwing Lua runtime errors.
- Lua cannot pass `model`, `temperature`, `max_tokens`, `base_url`, `api_key`, `dimensions`, or provider-specific parameters.
- LuaSkills passes caller context to host callbacks for audit and cost attribution, but does not expose that context through the model API.
- Model configuration, API keys, provider routing, timeouts, budgets, and redaction remain host responsibilities.

Host integration references:

- [Runtime architecture model capability boundary](architecture/runtime-model.md#standard-model-capability-boundary)
- [FFI and SDK model capability quick path](ffi/overview.md#model-capability-quick-path)
- [Chinese FFI model callback guide](zh-CN/ffi/integration-guide.md#98-模型能力-callback)

## 4.6 `vulcan.host.*`

`vulcan.host.*` is a fixed bridge for host-registered tools.
It is intentionally narrower than arbitrary `vulcan.xxx` injection: Lua can list, probe, and call host tools, but it cannot create new top-level namespaces or register host tools itself.

### 4.6.1 API Reference

| API | Parameters And Types | Return Value | Notes |
| --- | --- | --- | --- |
| `vulcan.host.list()` | none | `table` | host-visible tool metadata; exact shape is host-defined |
| `vulcan.host.has(tool_name)` | `tool_name: string` | `boolean` | probes one host tool |
| `vulcan.host.has_tool(tool_name)` | `tool_name: string` | `boolean` | alias of `has` |
| `vulcan.host.call(tool_name, args)` | `tool_name: string`; `args: table` | `table` | calls one host tool and returns the result |

Minimal example:

```lua
if not vulcan.host.has("vault.lookup") then
    return {
        ok = false,
        reason = "host-tool-unavailable",
    }
end

local result = vulcan.host.call("vault.lookup", {
    key = "demo-secret",
})

if not result.ok then
    return result
end

return result.value
```

### 4.6.2 Recommended Result Envelopes

Recommended success envelope:

```lua
{
    ok = true,
    value = {
        text = "resolved value",
    },
    meta = {
        elapsed_ms = 120,
    },
}
```

Recommended error envelope:

```lua
{
    ok = false,
    error = {
        code = "tool_not_found",
        message = "host tool not found: vault.lookup",
    },
}
```

### 4.6.3 Runtime Normalization Rules

- `list()` returns an empty table `{}` when the host has not registered a host-tool callback.
- `has()` / `has_tool()` return `false` when the host has not registered a callback.
- The host callback behind `has()` may return:
  - one `boolean`
  - one object with boolean `exists`, `has`, or `available`
- `call()` requires `args` to be a Lua table. An empty table stays an empty JSON object `{}`, not an empty array `[]`.
- If the host `call` callback returns an object, the runtime forwards it as-is.
- If the host `call` callback returns one scalar or array, the runtime wraps it as:

```lua
{
    ok = true,
    value = <host raw value>,
}
```

- When no host callback is registered, `call()` returns:

```lua
{
    ok = false,
    error = {
        code = "host_tool_callback_missing",
        message = "...",
    },
}
```

- When callback dispatch itself fails, `call()` returns:

```lua
{
    ok = false,
    error = {
        code = "host_tool_callback_error",
        message = "...",
    },
}
```

### 4.6.4 Behavior Rules

- `args` must be a Lua table. Use explicit keys for object-shaped inputs.
- Streaming is not part of this bridge. Host tools should return one complete table result.
- Permissions, timeouts, audit, and secret handling remain host responsibilities.
- Standard model capabilities should use `vulcan.models.*`, not a long-term generic host-tool contract.

## 5. `vulcan.runtime.*`

### 5.1 `vulcan.runtime.log(level, message)`

Writes one runtime log message to the host.

```lua
vulcan.runtime.log("info", "skill started")
vulcan.runtime.log("warn", "budget is low")
vulcan.runtime.log("error", "query failed")
```

API contract:

| Item | Type | Meaning |
| --- | --- | --- |
| `level` | `string` | usually `info`, `warn`, or `error`; runtime matches by text |
| `message` | `string` | text written to host logging |
| Return value | `nil` | no business value is returned |

Notes:

- If `level` contains `error` or `fatal`, the runtime logs it as an error.
- If `level` contains `warn`, the runtime logs it as a warning.
- All other values are logged as normal information.
- This capability is available in normal skill VMs.
- It is disabled in `vulcan.runtime.lua.exec(...)`.

### 5.2 `vulcan.runtime.cwd()`

Returns the current process working directory.

```lua
local cwd = vulcan.runtime.cwd()
```

| Return Value | Type | Meaning |
| --- | --- | --- |
| `cwd` | `string` | current host process working directory |

### 5.3 `vulcan.runtime.temp_dir`

Host-injected temporary directory path. It may be `nil`.

```lua
local temp_dir = vulcan.runtime.temp_dir
```

| Field | Type | Meaning |
| --- | --- | --- |
| `vulcan.runtime.temp_dir` | `string \| nil` | host-configured temp directory, or `nil` when absent |

### 5.4 `vulcan.runtime.resources_dir`

Host-injected resources directory path. It may be `nil`.

```lua
local resources_dir = vulcan.runtime.resources_dir
```

| Field | Type | Meaning |
| --- | --- | --- |
| `vulcan.runtime.resources_dir` | `string \| nil` | host-configured resources directory, or `nil` when absent |

### 5.5 `vulcan.runtime.overflow_type`

Currently exposes two fixed constants:

- `vulcan.runtime.overflow_type.truncate`
- `vulcan.runtime.overflow_type.page`

They are mainly used by host-side budget and overflow policy logic.

### 5.6 `vulcan.runtime.internal`

Currently exposes these fields:

- `tool_name`
- `skill_name`
- `entry_name`
- `root_name`
- `luaexec_active`
- `luaexec_caller_tool_name`

Field notes:

| Field | Type | Meaning |
| --- | --- | --- |
| `tool_name` | `string \| nil` | current externally visible canonical tool name |
| `skill_name` | `string \| nil` | current skill identifier |
| `entry_name` | `string \| nil` | current local entry name inside the skill |
| `root_name` | `string \| nil` | current runtime root layer such as `ROOT`, `PROJECT`, or `USER` |
| `luaexec_active` | `boolean` | whether the current call is inside the `vulcan.runtime.lua.exec(...)` path |
| `luaexec_caller_tool_name` | `string \| nil` | outer tool name that triggered the current `luaexec` call |

These are **internal execution-context fields**. Use them for debugging, logging, and diagnostics only, not as long-term public protocol.

### 5.7 `vulcan.runtime.lua.exec(input)`

Runs one isolated inline Lua runtime call and returns a **Markdown string**, not a normal Lua table.

Supported input fields:

| Field | Type | Required | Meaning |
| --- | --- | --- | --- |
| `task` | `string` | no | human-readable task summary shown in the rendered result |
| `code` | `string` | one of `code` / `file` | inline Lua source to execute |
| `file` | `string` | one of `code` / `file` | Lua file path to execute |
| `args` | `table` | no | structured argument object injected into the execution context; defaults to an empty object |
| `timeout_ms` | `integer` | no | timeout in milliseconds; defaults to `60000` |

Minimal example:

```lua
local rendered = vulcan.runtime.lua.exec({
    task = "inspect args",
    code = [[
        print("hello", args.name)
        return { ok = true, name = args.name }
    ]],
    args = {
        name = "codex",
    },
})

return rendered
```

Return and behavior:

| Item | Type | Meaning |
| --- | --- | --- |
| Return value | `string` | rendered Markdown text |
| `print(...)` output | text | collected and appended into the rendered result |
| code return value | any JSON-serializable value | rendered into the result text instead of being returned as a Lua table |

Important limits:

- The return value is rendered Markdown text, not a structured Lua table.
- The isolated environment overrides global `print` and collects output into the result text.
- The isolated environment disables:
  - `vulcan.runtime.log`
  - `vulcan.cache.put`
  - `vulcan.cache.get`
  - `vulcan.cache.delete`
  - `vulcan.runtime.lua.exec` itself, preventing recursive luaexec calls
- This environment uses an internal synthetic request context. Inside `luaexec`, values such as:
  - `vulcan.context.client_info.name`
  - `vulcan.context.request.transport_name`
  usually use internal identifiers such as `luaexec_call`, not the real external client.
- The isolated execution path has its own VM pool:
  - Default `min_size=1 / max_size=4 / idle_ttl_secs=60`.
  - Hosts can override it through `LuaRuntimeHostOptions.runlua_pool_config`.
  - This only affects `vulcan.runtime.lua.exec(...)` and does not change the normal skill VM pool.
  - The runtime no longer supports configuring a separate external executor path for `vulcan.runtime.lua.exec(...)`.
- This call resets request-scoped state and does not inherit arbitrary ad hoc globals you may have written into the outer VM.

### 5.8 `vulcan.runtime.skills.*`

These capabilities let a skill ask the host to install, update, enable, disable, or uninstall skills.

The formal layer model is:

```text
ROOT -> PROJECT -> USER
```

`ROOT` is system-controlled, and a runtime must receive a `ROOT` layer when it starts or loads. Normal skills cannot use `vulcan.runtime.skills.*` to install, update, uninstall, enable, or disable `ROOT` skills. The normal bridge only targets currently existing `PROJECT` and `USER` layers exposed by the host.

`vulcan.runtime.skills.*` is always equivalent to `DelegatedTool` authority: it cannot see `ROOT` skills and cannot write `ROOT`. FFI query and prompt-completion entry points under `DelegatedTool` also do not return `ROOT` entries, help, or ROOT tool ownership. `call_skill` and `run_lua` are runtime execution surfaces: they can call currently active skills, but they are not skill-management authorization boundaries. If `ROOT` already contains the same `skill_id`, normal-layer install and update are rejected; normal-layer uninstall can still clean stale same-name entries from `PROJECT` or `USER`.

The formal bridge should include:

- `vulcan.runtime.skills.enabled`
- `vulcan.runtime.skills.status()`
- `vulcan.runtime.skills.layers()`
- `vulcan.runtime.skills.install(input)`
- `vulcan.runtime.skills.update(input)`
- `vulcan.runtime.skills.uninstall(input)`
- `vulcan.runtime.skills.enable(input)`
- `vulcan.runtime.skills.disable(input)`

Stable fields:

| API / Field | Type | Meaning |
| --- | --- | --- |
| `vulcan.runtime.skills.enabled` | `boolean` | whether host policy enabled the management bridge |
| `status().enabled` | `boolean` | same policy state |
| `status().callback_registered` | `boolean` | whether the host actually registered a callback |
| `status().mode` | `string` | currently fixed to `host_callback` |
| `status().message` | `string` | current bridge-state description |

`layers()` returns the layer labels that the host allows the normal bridge to operate on. Recommended fields include:

- `default`
- `writable`
- `labels`
- `layers`

`labels` should include only currently existing `PROJECT` and `USER` layers; it should not include `ROOT`. Without a project context, the runtime returns only `USER`. If only `ROOT` exists, it returns an empty list and top-level `writable=false`. When the bridge is disabled, layer discovery can still work, but top-level `writable` and each layer's `writable` must be `false`. If future install, update, or uninstall inputs allow selecting a layer, they should only accept labels returned by `layers()`.

For the full layer and management boundary model, see [Skill root layer policy](zh-CN/architecture/skill-root-layer-policy.md).

Notes:

- These capabilities only execute when the host explicitly enables `enable_skill_management_bridge`.
- Even when host policy enables the bridge, missing callbacks return explicit errors.
- `install/update/uninstall/enable/disable` request and response payloads are part of the host bridge contract. The runtime dispatches them but does not define your business schema.
- If one payload explicitly targets the `ROOT` layer, the runtime rejects it before dispatch.

### 5.9 `vulcan.config.*`

These capabilities read and maintain **string config for the current skill itself**.

Currently available:

| API | Parameters And Types | Return Value | Notes |
| --- | --- | --- | --- |
| `vulcan.config.get(key)` | `key: string` | `string \| nil` | reads one current-skill config value |
| `vulcan.config.has(key)` | `key: string` | `boolean` | checks whether one key exists |
| `vulcan.config.set(key, value)` | `key: string`; `value: string` | `true` | writes one current-skill config value |
| `vulcan.config.delete(key)` | `key: string` | `boolean` | deletes one key; exact return semantics come from the backing store |
| `vulcan.config.list()` | none | `table<string, string>` | lists all string config values in the current skill namespace |

Minimal example:

```lua
local api_token = vulcan.config.get("api_token")

if not api_token or api_token == "" then
    return "The current skill has no `api_token` configured. Use the host runtime-config tool to set `api_token` for this skill."
end

local endpoint = vulcan.config.get("endpoint") or "https://api.example.com"

vulcan.config.set("last_endpoint", endpoint)

return {
    ok = true,
    endpoint = endpoint,
}
```

`list()` currently returns a flat table for the current skill namespace:

```lua
local config = vulcan.config.list()
-- config.api_token
-- config.endpoint
```

Notes:

- Config values are strings in the first version.
- If you need complex structure, store JSON text as a string and decode it with `vulcan.json.decode(...)` inside the skill.
- Config defaults to the current skill. Skills cannot directly read or write other skill namespaces.
- These APIs **require one active skill context**. They raise an error in system runtimes that do not currently represent one skill identity.
- The runtime does not automatically refuse to load a skill just because config is missing. Prefer returning clear guidance when required config is absent.
- The unified main config file defaults to `<runtime_root>/config/skill_config.json`; hosts can explicitly override the path.

## 6. `vulcan.fs.*`

### 6.1 API Reference

| API | Parameters And Types | Return Value | Notes |
| --- | --- | --- | --- |
| `vulcan.fs.list(dir)` | `dir: string` | `string[]` | returns directory entry names only, not full paths |
| `vulcan.fs.read(path)` | `path: string` | `string` | reads one whole file as UTF-8 text; non-UTF-8 content errors |
| `vulcan.fs.write(path, content)` | `path: string`; `content: string` | `true` | overwrites text; does not create parent directories |
| `vulcan.fs.read_bytes(path)` | `path: string` | `string` | returns raw bytes as Base64 text |
| `vulcan.fs.write_bytes(path, base64_text)` | `path: string`; `base64_text: string` | `true` | decodes Base64 and writes raw bytes |
| `vulcan.fs.rename(old_path, new_path)` | `old_path: string`; `new_path: string` | `true` | renames or moves one file or directory |
| `vulcan.fs.copy(src_path, dst_path, options?)` | `src_path: string`; `dst_path: string`; `options?: { overwrite?: boolean }` | `boolean` | copies one regular file or one whole directory tree; returns `false` when the destination already exists and overwrite is not allowed |
| `vulcan.fs.remove(path, options?)` | `path: string`; `options?: { recursive?: boolean }` | `boolean` | removes one file or directory; returns `false` when the target is already missing |
| `vulcan.fs.mkdir(path, options?)` | `path: string`; `options?: { recursive?: boolean }` | `boolean` | creates one directory; returns `false` when the target directory already exists |
| `vulcan.fs.stat(path)` | `path: string` | `table \| nil` | returns `nil` when missing, otherwise a metadata table |
| `vulcan.fs.exists(path)` | `path: string` | `boolean` | checks whether the path exists |
| `vulcan.fs.is_dir(path)` | `path: string` | `boolean` | checks whether the path is a directory |

### 6.2 `fs.stat(path)` Result Shape

When the target exists, `vulcan.fs.stat(path)` returns:

| Field | Type | Meaning |
| --- | --- | --- |
| `kind` | `"file" \| "dir" \| "symlink" \| "other"` | normalized target kind |
| `is_file` | `boolean` | whether the target is a regular file |
| `is_dir` | `boolean` | whether the target is a directory |
| `is_symlink` | `boolean` | whether the target is a symbolic link |
| `readonly` | `boolean` | whether the metadata is read-only |
| `size` | `integer?` | file size in bytes for regular files |
| `modified_unix_ms` | `integer?` | Unix modification timestamp in milliseconds when available |

### 6.3 Example

```lua
local entries = vulcan.fs.list(vulcan.context.entry_dir)
local exists = vulcan.fs.exists(vulcan.context.entry_file)
local content = vulcan.fs.read(vulcan.context.entry_file)
local payload_base64 = vulcan.fs.read_bytes(vulcan.context.entry_file)
local info = vulcan.fs.stat(vulcan.context.entry_file)
local created = vulcan.fs.mkdir(vulcan.path.join(vulcan.context.entry_dir, "output"), {
    recursive = true,
})
```

Byte-preserving example:

```lua
local payload = vulcan.fs.read_bytes("D:/data/image.bin")

vulcan.fs.write_bytes("D:/data/image.copy.bin", payload)
```

### 6.4 Notes

- There is currently no sandbox restriction; a skill can theoretically access any path that the host process can access.
- `fs.list(dir)` returns child names only. Use `vulcan.path.join(...)` to build full paths.
- `fs.read` and `fs.write` operate on text. `fs.read` expects valid UTF-8. Use `fs.read_bytes` for non-UTF-8 content.
- `fs.read_bytes(path)` returns Base64 text, and `fs.write_bytes(path, base64_text)` accepts Base64 text and writes the original bytes. This is the preferred byte-preserving path when non-UTF-8 content must cross the Lua/host boundary.
- Prefer `fs.rename`, `fs.remove`, and `fs.mkdir` for file lifecycle changes that need stable Windows Unicode-path behavior instead of relying on native `os.rename` or `os.remove`.
- `fs.copy(src_path, dst_path)` does not overwrite an existing destination unless `{ overwrite = true }` is explicitly provided.
- Destination-existence checks are based on the path entry itself, so dangling symbolic links still count as existing destinations.
- When the source path is a directory, `fs.copy` recursively copies the whole directory tree.
- When `overwrite = true` and the destination already exists, the runtime deletes the destination path first and then copies the new content. This means the destination tree is **replaced**, not merged.
- When the source path is a directory, destination validation resolves existing parent links before deciding whether the destination falls back inside the source tree.
- Directory-tree copy currently rejects symbolic-link entries so behavior stays predictable across platforms.
- When the source path is a directory, the destination path must not equal the source directory and must not live inside the source directory; otherwise the runtime raises an explicit error instead of recursing into itself.
- `fs.remove(path, { recursive = true })` recursively deletes directories and returns `false` when the target is already missing.
- `fs.remove(path)` without `recursive = true` attempts a normal directory removal and errors for non-empty directories.
- When the path itself is a symbolic link, `fs.remove` removes the link entry itself instead of deleting the linked target.
- `fs.mkdir(path, { recursive = true })` recursively creates directories and returns `false` when the target directory already exists.
- `fs.mkdir(path)` errors when the target path already exists but is not a directory.
- `fs.rename(old_path, new_path)` returns `true` on success and raises a runtime error for other failures.
- `fs.stat(path)` returns `nil` when the target is missing; otherwise it returns a table with fields such as `kind`, `is_file`, `is_dir`, `is_symlink`, `readonly`, optional `size` for regular files, and optional `modified_unix_ms`.
- Path arguments must be strings and pass basic path syntax validation.

## 7. `vulcan.path.*`

### 7.1 API Reference

| API | Parameters And Types | Return Value | Notes |
| --- | --- | --- | --- |
| `vulcan.path.join(...)` | one or more `string` segments | `string` | joins path segments using host rules; at least one segment is required |
| `vulcan.path.dirname(path)` | `path: string` | `string` | returns the parent directory |
| `vulcan.path.basename(path)` | `path: string` | `string` | returns the terminal file name portion |
| `vulcan.path.stem(path)` | `path: string` | `string` | returns the terminal file name without extension |
| `vulcan.path.extname(path)` | `path: string` | `string` | returns the extension including the leading dot |
| `vulcan.path.normalize(path)` | `path: string` | `string` | performs lexical normalization without touching the filesystem |
| `vulcan.path.is_abs(path)` | `path: string` | `boolean` | checks whether one path is absolute |

### 7.2 Example

```lua
local config_path = vulcan.path.join(
    vulcan.context.skill_dir,
    "runtime",
    "config.json"
)
local ext = vulcan.path.extname(config_path)
```

### 7.3 Return Rules

- Returns normal path text for the host system.
- On Windows, it does not leak `\\?\` or `\\?\UNC\` verbatim prefixes directly to Lua.
- `path.dirname(path)` returns `.` when a relative path has no parent segment.
- `path.basename(path)`, `path.stem(path)`, and `path.extname(path)` return an empty string when the terminal component is absent.
- `path.extname(path)` includes the leading dot when an extension exists, for example `.lua`.
- `path.normalize(path)` is lexical only. It folds `.` and `..` without touching the filesystem and returns `.` when the normalized result is empty.

## 8. `vulcan.process.*`

### 8.1 API Reference

| API | Parameters And Types | Return Value | Notes |
| --- | --- | --- | --- |
| `vulcan.process.exec(spec)` | `spec: string \| table` | result table | runs one one-shot child process and waits for completion |
| `vulcan.process.launchers()` | none | `table` | returns the supported `shell` parameter values and the current default |
| `vulcan.process.which(program)` | `program: string` | `string \| nil` | searches for one executable |
| `vulcan.process.session.open(spec)` | `spec: table` | process-session handle | opens one interactive child-process session |

`vulcan.process.which(program)` searches for one executable using host lookup rules. It returns one host-visible absolute path when found and `nil` otherwise. On Windows it also consults `PATHEXT` for extensionless names.

`vulcan.process.launchers()` always returns:

| Field | Type | Meaning |
| --- | --- | --- |
| `default` | `string` | current host default shell parameter value; typically `cmd` on Windows and `sh` on Unix-like hosts |
| `shells` | `array<string>` | supported `shell` parameter values in stable order; the default value is always the first item |

Minimal example:

```lua
local launchers = vulcan.process.launchers()
local shell = launchers.default

for _, name in ipairs(launchers.shells or {}) do
    if name == "bash" then
        shell = "bash"
        break
    end
    if name == "pwsh" then
        shell = "pwsh"
        break
    end
end

local command = shell == "cmd" and "dir" or "ls"
local result = vulcan.process.exec({
    command = command,
    shell = shell,
})
```

### 8.2 `exec(spec)` Request Shape

`vulcan.process.exec(spec)` supports two input forms:

1. a string, which means shell/command mode
2. a table with explicit launch fields

Minimal string mode:

```lua
local result = vulcan.process.exec("echo hello")
```

Table fields:

| Field | Type | Required | Meaning |
| --- | --- | --- | --- |
| `command` | `string` | one of `command` / `program` | shell command text |
| `program` | `string` | one of `command` / `program` | executable path or program name |
| `args` | `array` | no | only valid in `program` mode; string arrays are recommended, but numbers and booleans are stringified |
| `cwd` | `string` | no | child working directory |
| `env` | `table<string, scalar>` | no | environment variable map; values are stringified |
| `stdin` | `string` | no | one-shot stdin text written after spawn |
| `timeout_ms` | `integer` | no | positive timeout in milliseconds; omitted means no timeout |
| `shell` | `boolean \| string` | no | optional in `command` mode; booleans keep legacy compatibility, and strings must come from `vulcan.process.launchers().shells` |
| `encoding` | `string` | no | default encoding for stdout, stderr, and stdin |
| `stdout_encoding` | `string` | no | overrides stdout decoding |
| `stderr_encoding` | `string` | no | overrides stderr decoding |
| `stdin_encoding` | `string` | no | overrides stdin encoding |

`shell` rules:

- omit `shell`: `command` mode automatically uses `vulcan.process.launchers().default`
- `shell = true`: legacy-compatible shorthand for the default shell
- `shell = false`: only valid with `program` mode; `command` mode rejects it
- `shell = "cmd" | "pwsh" | "powershell" | "bash" | "zsh" | "sh"`: explicitly selects one command carrier and must appear in `vulcan.process.launchers().shells`
- `program` mode rejects shell-name strings because it does not use a shell carrier

`command` mode example:

```lua
local result = vulcan.process.exec({
    command = "echo hello",
    timeout_ms = 3000,
})
```

Example using `launchers()` to choose one shell:

```lua
local launchers = vulcan.process.launchers()
local command = launchers.default == "cmd" and "echo hello" or "printf hello"

local result = vulcan.process.exec({
    command = command,
    shell = launchers.default,
    encoding = "utf-8",
})
```

`program` mode example:

```lua
local result = vulcan.process.exec({
    program = "git",
    args = { "status", "--short" },
    cwd = vulcan.runtime.cwd(),
    env = {
        DEMO_MODE = "1",
    },
    timeout_ms = 5000,
    encoding = "utf-8",
})
```

### 8.3 `exec(spec)` Result Shape

The result table always contains:

| Field | Type | Meaning |
| --- | --- | --- |
| `ok` | `boolean` | whether the execution chain completed successfully |
| `success` | `boolean` | whether the process exited successfully without timing out |
| `code` | `integer \| nil` | exit code when available |
| `stdout` | `string` | decoded stdout text, or Base64 text when `base64` encoding is used |
| `stderr` | `string` | decoded stderr text |
| `stdout_encoding` | `string` | actual stdout decoding label |
| `stderr_encoding` | `string` | actual stderr decoding label |
| `stdout_lossy` | `boolean` | whether stdout decoding used replacement or fallback behavior |
| `stderr_lossy` | `boolean` | whether stderr decoding used replacement or fallback behavior |
| `stdout_base64` | `string \| nil` | raw stdout bytes encoded as Base64 when available |
| `stderr_base64` | `string \| nil` | raw stderr bytes encoded as Base64 when available |
| `timed_out` | `boolean` | whether the process timed out |
| `error` | `string \| nil` | human-readable execution failure summary |

### 8.4 `session.open(spec)` And Session Handle

`vulcan.process.session.open(spec)` accepts only a table:

| Field | Type | Required | Meaning |
| --- | --- | --- | --- |
| `program` | `string` | yes | executable path or program name |
| `args` | `string[]` | no | argument array; defaults to an empty array |
| `cwd` | `string` | no | child working directory |
| `encoding` | `string` | no | default encoding for stdout, stderr, and stdin |
| `stdout_encoding` | `string` | no | overrides stdout decoding |
| `stderr_encoding` | `string` | no | overrides stderr decoding |
| `stdin_encoding` | `string` | no | overrides stdin encoding |
| `buffer_limit_bytes` | `integer` | no | internal stdout/stderr buffer limit |

Session-handle methods:

| Method | Parameters And Types | Return Value | Meaning |
| --- | --- | --- | --- |
| `session:write(...)` | one or more Lua scalar values | `true` | encodes values with `stdin_encoding`, writes them to stdin, and flushes immediately |
| `session:read(options?)` | `options?: { timeout_ms?: integer, max_bytes?: integer, until_text?: string }` | result table | reads and **drains** currently captured output |
| `session:status()` | none | status table | inspects status without terminating the process |
| `session:close(options?)` | `options?: { timeout_ms?: integer }` | status table | closes stdin, waits for exit, and kills the process tree on timeout |
| `session:kill()` | none | `true` | terminates the process tree immediately |

`session:read(...)` returns:

| Field | Type | Meaning |
| --- | --- | --- |
| `stdout` | `string` | stdout drained by this read call |
| `stderr` | `string` | stderr drained by this read call |
| `stdout_encoding` | `string` | actual stdout decoding label |
| `stderr_encoding` | `string` | actual stderr decoding label |
| `stdout_lossy` | `boolean` | whether stdout decoding was lossy |
| `stderr_lossy` | `boolean` | whether stderr decoding was lossy |
| `stdout_base64` | `string \| nil` | raw stdout bytes when available |
| `stderr_base64` | `string \| nil` | raw stderr bytes when available |
| `timed_out` | `boolean` | whether this read wait timed out |

`session:status()` and `session:close(...)` return:

| Field | Type | Meaning |
| --- | --- | --- |
| `running` | `boolean` | whether the process is still running |
| `exited` | `boolean` | whether the process has exited |
| `success` | `boolean \| nil` | exit success when exited; usually `nil` while still running |
| `code` | `integer \| nil` | exit code when available |

Interactive example:

```lua
local session = vulcan.process.session.open({
    program = "python",
    args = { "-i" },
    encoding = "utf-8",
})

session:write("print(1 + 1)\n")
local output = session:read({
    timeout_ms = 1000,
    until_text = "2",
})
local status = session:close({
    timeout_ms = 3000,
})

return vulcan.json.encode({
    stdout = output.stdout,
    exited = status.exited,
    success = status.success,
})
```

### 8.5 Notes

- `exec(spec)` and `session.open(spec)` do not perform shell escaping for you. If you build command text manually, you own that safety boundary.
- `session:read(...)` drains buffered output. The next read only sees newly produced bytes.
- `session:close(...)` kills the whole process tree on timeout, not just the direct child.
- `which(program)` supports both explicit paths and `PATH` lookup. On Windows it also expands common executable extensions via `PATHEXT`.

## 9. `vulcan.os.*`

Currently provides:

- `vulcan.os.info()`

Example:

```lua
local info = vulcan.os.info()
-- info.os
-- info.arch
```

Result shape:

| Field | Type | Meaning |
| --- | --- | --- |
| `os` | `string` | normalized platform name such as `windows`, `linux`, or `macos` |
| `arch` | `string` | normalized architecture such as `x86_64`, `i686`, `aarch64`, or `armv7l` |

`vulcan.os.*` intentionally stays minimal. It provides platform information only and does not try to wrap historically problematic native `os.rename` or `os.remove` behavior.

## 10. `vulcan.json.*`

Currently provides:

- `vulcan.json.encode(value)`
- `vulcan.json.decode(text)`

Example:

```lua
local text = vulcan.json.encode({
    hello = "world",
    limit = 3,
})

local obj = vulcan.json.decode(text)
```

Notes:

| API | Parameters And Types | Return Value | Notes |
| --- | --- | --- | --- |
| `vulcan.json.encode(value)` | any JSON-serializable Lua value | `string` | encodes JSON text |
| `vulcan.json.decode(text)` | `text: string` | Lua value | decodes JSON text |

Encoding rules:

- `nil` -> `null`
- `boolean` -> JSON boolean
- `integer` / `number` -> JSON number
- `string` -> JSON string
- `table` -> JSON array or object

Array/object detection is important:

- when one Lua table has `raw_len() > 0`, the runtime serializes it as an **array**
- when `raw_len() == 0` and the table has string keys, the runtime serializes it as an **object**
- an empty table becomes `[]`, not `{}`

Unsupported input values:

- `function`
- `thread`
- `userdata`
- `lightuserdata`

Passing those values to `vulcan.json.encode(...)` raises a runtime error.

## 11. `vulcan.cache.*`

Currently provides:

| API | Parameters And Types | Return Value | Notes |
| --- | --- | --- | --- |
| `vulcan.cache.put(value, ttl_sec?)` | `value: JSON-serializable Lua value`; `ttl_sec?: integer` | `string` | stores one cache value and returns the `cache_id` |
| `vulcan.cache.get(cache_id)` | `cache_id: string` | Lua value or `nil` | reads one cached value inside the current scope |
| `vulcan.cache.delete(cache_id)` | `cache_id: string` | `boolean` | deletes one cache item |

Example:

```lua
local cache_id = vulcan.cache.put({
    summary = "warm result",
}, 60)

local cached = vulcan.cache.get(cache_id)
local deleted = vulcan.cache.delete(cache_id)
```

Notes:

- The serialization rules for `value` are the same as `vulcan.json.encode(...)`.
- Cache scope first falls back to the current `tool_name`, then the current `skill_name`.
- If neither is available, it falls back to the internal `__runtime` scope.
- Inside `vulcan.runtime.lua.exec(...)`, cache APIs are actively removed and unavailable.
- `cache_id` is a scope-local identifier. Do not assume it is stable across skills or host instances.

## 12. `vulcan.context.*`

`vulcan.context` reads the current request and current-entry runtime context.

### 12.1 Top-Level Field Overview

| Field | Type | Default | Meaning |
| --- | --- | --- | --- |
| `request` | `table` | empty table | raw request context |
| `client_info` | `table \| nil` | `nil` | current client metadata |
| `client_capabilities` | `table` | empty table | host-injected client capability snapshot |
| `client_budget` | `table` | empty table | host-injected budget snapshot |
| `tool_config` | `table` | empty table | host-injected tool configuration |
| `host_result` | `table` | empty table | host structured-result capability view |
| `skill_dir` | `string \| nil` | `nil` | current skill root directory |
| `entry_dir` | `string \| nil` | `nil` | current entry directory |
| `entry_file` | `string \| nil` | `nil` | current entry absolute file path |

### 12.2 `vulcan.context.request`

The original host-provided request context object. Defaults to an empty object.

Common fields come from:

- `transport_name`
- `session_id`
- `request_id`
- `client_name`
- `client_info`
- `client_capabilities`

This structure is host-defined. Skills should not assume one exact field is always present.

### 12.3 `vulcan.context.client_info`

Current request client metadata. Common fields:

- `kind`
- `name`
- `version`

Notes:

- If the host does not inject `client_info`, this may be `nil`.
- If you see `name = "luaexec_call"` inside `luaexec`, that is the synthetic context for internal isolated execution, not the real external client.

### 12.4 `vulcan.context.client_capabilities`

Host-provided client capability object. Defaults to an empty object.

### 12.5 `vulcan.context.client_budget`

Host-parsed budget snapshot object. Defaults to an empty object.

The host decides the shape, but common fields include:

- `client_name`
- `tool_name`
- `skill_name`
- `tool_result`
- `file_read`

### 12.6 `vulcan.context.tool_config`

Host-parsed tool config object. Defaults to an empty object.

### 12.7 `vulcan.context.skill_dir / entry_dir / entry_file`

File context for the currently executing skill:

- `skill_dir`: current skill directory.
- `entry_dir`: current entry script directory.
- `entry_file`: current entry script full path.

Notes:

- In normal skill calls, all three are usually available.
- In some runlua, help, or non-skill-file scenarios, they may be `nil`.
- In `system_runtime_lease` / `system_lua_lib` host-runtime scenarios, all three should also be treated as `nil` because there is no current skill-file identity.
- The current implementation automatically strips Windows verbatim path prefixes so Lua receives normal system paths.

### 12.8 `vulcan.context.host_result`

The standardized host structured-result bridge view.

Current recommended fields:

- `enabled`
- `allowed_kinds`
- `max_payload_bytes`

Notes:

- In the current runtime baseline, the top-level `host_result` table always exists, but it typically does not contain `enabled = true` unless the host explicitly turned it on.
- Skills that support structured host results should prefer this normalized view over reading raw `client_capabilities.host_result` fields directly.
- The current recommended canonical result kind is `change_set`, used to return IDE-grade operation results back to the host.

### 12.9 Structured fourth return value

When the host explicitly enables `host_result`, one skill may return:

```lua
return content, overflow_mode, template_hint, host_result
```

Where:

- `content` remains the main text result.
- `overflow_mode` and `template_hint` keep their existing text-path meaning.
- the fourth return value `host_result` is a separate host-structured result source and does not replace the main text result.

Recommended shape:

```lua
return "Applied 1 edit.", nil, nil, {
    kind = "change_set",
    payload = {
        mode = "applied",
        summary = "Updated one file.",
        files = {
            {
                change = "modify",
                path = "D:/projects/demo/src/example.lua",
                hunks = {
                    {
                        before = "local a = 1\nlocal b = 2",
                        delete = {
                            { line = 10, content = "local x = 1" },
                            { line = 11, content = "return x" },
                        },
                        insert = {
                            { line = 10, content = "local x = 2" },
                            { line = 11, content = "local y = 3" },
                            { line = 12, content = "return x + y" },
                        },
                        after = "end\nreturn M",
                    },
                },
            },
        },
    },
}
```

Notes:

- When the host does not enable `host_result`, the fourth return value is ignored.
- `host_result` should stay JSON-serializable.
- For skill authors, `change_set` exists to provide operation-level results, not to replace `git diff`.
- `change_set.payload.files` should now always be present and should use absolute paths.
- When `change = "modify"`, one file record must provide one non-empty `hunks` array; every hunk must include `before`, `after`, `delete`, and `insert`.
- `before` and `after` should be contiguous context strings immediately adjacent to the changed block, not whole-file snapshots.
- `delete[].line` uses old-file line numbers, while `insert[].line` uses new-file line numbers after insertion, and both lists should stay sorted in ascending order.
- When `change = "create"`, the file record should directly provide full-file `content`.
- When `change = "delete"`, two content modes are supported:
  - `content_mode = "full"`, or omit `content_mode` entirely. In this mode the record should provide full-file `content`; `total_line_count` is optional on input, and the runtime will fill both `content_mode = "full"` and `total_line_count` automatically.
  - `content_mode = "truncated"`. In this mode the record must provide `total_line_count`, `content_head`, and `content_tail`; `content_head` is the leading snippet, `content_tail` is the trailing snippet, and the middle section is always considered omitted.
- Strong guidance for skill authors: handle oversized delete results proactively inside the skill whenever possible, and decide before returning whether one truncated snippet form is more appropriate; runtime auto-truncation is only a fallback safety net and should not be treated as the primary path.
- The runtime normalization rules for `change = "delete"` are stable:
  - If the skill returns full `content`, the runtime first computes `total_line_count`.
  - When the deleted content stays within `500` lines, the runtime keeps the full body and normalizes the record to `content_mode = "full"`.
  - When the deleted content exceeds `500` lines, the runtime forcibly rewrites the record to `content_mode = "truncated"`, even if the skill returned the full `content`.
  - The forced truncation shape is fixed: the first `50` lines go to `content_head`, the last `50` lines go to `content_tail`, and the middle section is not returned.
- When `change = "rename"`, the file record should provide both `old_path` and `new_path`, and both must be absolute paths.

Delete record example:

```lua
{
    change = "delete",
    path = "D:/projects/demo/src/legacy.lua",
    content = "line 1\nline 2\nline 3\n"
}
```

The legacy form above remains compatible, but the runtime normalizes the host-facing payload into:

```json
{
  "change": "delete",
  "path": "D:/projects/demo/src/legacy.lua",
  "content_mode": "full",
  "total_line_count": 3,
  "content": "line 1\nline 2\nline 3\n"
}
```

When the deleted file exceeds `500` lines, the runtime automatically rewrites it into:

```json
{
  "change": "delete",
  "path": "D:/projects/demo/src/legacy.lua",
  "content_mode": "truncated",
  "total_line_count": 1200,
  "content_head": "Joined text of the first 50 lines",
  "content_tail": "Joined text of the last 50 lines"
}
```

## 13. `vulcan.deps.*`

Current fields:

| Field | Type | Meaning |
| --- | --- | --- |
| `vulcan.deps.tools_path` | `string \| nil` | current skill tools dependency directory |
| `vulcan.deps.lua_path` | `string \| nil` | current skill Lua dependency directory |
| `vulcan.deps.ffi_path` | `string \| nil` | current skill FFI dependency directory |

These are dependency root paths for the current skill:

- Tool dependency directory.
- Lua dependency directory.
- FFI dependency directory.

Example:

```lua
local lua_lib_root = vulcan.deps.lua_path
local ffi_root = vulcan.deps.ffi_path
```

Notes:

- These paths depend on the current skill root and host dependency layout.
- If there is no valid current skill context, they are `nil`.
- In `system_runtime_lease` / `system_lua_lib` scenarios, they should also be treated as `nil` because there is no current skill dependency-root identity.
- Skills should rely on these protocol-exposed paths and should not guess the host's physical directory layout.

## 14. `vulcan.sqlite.*`

`vulcan.sqlite` is a SQLite binding isolated to the **current skill scope**.

### 14.1 Current Fields And Methods

- `vulcan.sqlite.enabled`
- `vulcan.sqlite.info()`
- `vulcan.sqlite.status()`
- `vulcan.sqlite.tokenize_text(input)`
- `vulcan.sqlite.execute_script(input)`
- `vulcan.sqlite.execute_batch(input)`
- `vulcan.sqlite.query_json(input)`
- `vulcan.sqlite.query_stream(input)`
- `vulcan.sqlite.query_stream_wait_metrics(input)`
- `vulcan.sqlite.query_stream_chunk(input)`
- `vulcan.sqlite.query_stream_close(input)`
- `vulcan.sqlite.upsert_custom_word(input)`
- `vulcan.sqlite.remove_custom_word(input)`
- `vulcan.sqlite.list_custom_words()`
- `vulcan.sqlite.ensure_fts_index(input)`
- `vulcan.sqlite.rebuild_fts_index(input)`
- `vulcan.sqlite.upsert_fts_document(input)`
- `vulcan.sqlite.delete_fts_document(input)`
- `vulcan.sqlite.search_fts(input)`

Aside from `enabled`, these methods fall into two groups:

| Category | API | Input | Return Value | Meaning |
| --- | --- | --- | --- | --- |
| Stable probe | `enabled` | none | `boolean` | whether the current skill has a SQLite binding |
| Stable probe | `info()` | none | `table` | binding information suitable for availability probing |
| Stable probe | `status()` | none | `table` | current status suitable for availability probing |
| Provider forward | every other method | one `input: table` or none | `table`, array, or scalar depending on the provider | LuaSkills only forwards the action plus current binding context |

Action mapping:

| Lua API | provider action |
| --- | --- |
| `execute_script(input)` | `execute_script` |
| `execute_batch(input)` | `execute_batch` |
| `query_json(input)` | `query_json` |
| `query_stream(input)` | `query_stream` |
| `query_stream_wait_metrics(input)` | `query_stream_wait_metrics` |
| `query_stream_chunk(input)` | `query_stream_chunk` |
| `query_stream_close(input)` | `query_stream_close` |
| `tokenize_text(input)` | `tokenize_text` |
| `upsert_custom_word(input)` | `upsert_custom_word` |
| `remove_custom_word(input)` | `remove_custom_word` |
| `list_custom_words()` | `list_custom_words` |
| `ensure_fts_index(input)` | `ensure_fts_index` |
| `rebuild_fts_index(input)` | `rebuild_fts_index` |
| `upsert_fts_document(input)` | `upsert_fts_document` |
| `delete_fts_document(input)` | `delete_fts_document` |
| `search_fts(input)` | `search_fts` |

### 14.2 Behavior Rules

- `enabled = true` means the current skill has a SQLite binding.
- `info()` and `status()` always exist.
- When SQLite is not enabled:
  - `enabled = false`
  - `info()` and `status()` return disabled-state descriptions
  - other methods error directly with `current skill has not enabled sqlite`

Stable development constraints:

- Pass one Lua table for `input`. Do not pass bare strings or bare arrays.
- Exact result shapes are defined by the active SQLite provider. LuaSkills does not normalize business fields on top.
- The host/provider also receives stable binding context such as `space_label`, `skill_id`, `binding_tag`, `database_kind`, and `default_database_path`.

### 14.3 Development Guidance

- Treat `info()` and `status()` as probing entry points.
- Check `enabled` before business calls so "capability not bound" is not mistaken for a query failure.
- For exact input and output fields, combine the host SQLite provider contract with:
  - [Host database provider guide](zh-CN/providers/host-database-provider-guide.md)
- If you are a skill author rather than a host implementer, prefer existing memory-skill examples over guessing provider-specific result fields.

## 15. `vulcan.lancedb.*`

`vulcan.lancedb` is a LanceDB binding isolated to the **current skill scope**.

### 15.1 Current Fields And Methods

- `vulcan.lancedb.enabled`
- `vulcan.lancedb.info()`
- `vulcan.lancedb.status()`
- `vulcan.lancedb.create_table(input)`
- `vulcan.lancedb.vector_upsert(input)`
- `vulcan.lancedb.vector_search(input)`
- `vulcan.lancedb.delete(input)`
- `vulcan.lancedb.drop_table(input)`

| Category | API | Input | Return Value | Meaning |
| --- | --- | --- | --- | --- |
| Stable probe | `enabled` | none | `boolean` | whether the current skill has a LanceDB binding |
| Stable probe | `info()` | none | `table` | binding information suitable for availability probing |
| Stable probe | `status()` | none | `table` | current status suitable for availability probing |
| Provider forward | `create_table(input)` | `input: table` | provider-defined | creates one table |
| Provider forward | `vector_upsert(input)` | `input: table` | provider-defined | upserts vector data |
| Provider forward | `vector_search(input)` | `input: table` | provider-defined | performs vector search |
| Provider forward | `delete(input)` | `input: table` | provider-defined | deletes records |
| Provider forward | `drop_table(input)` | `input: table` | provider-defined | drops one table |

### 15.2 Behavior Rules

- `enabled = true` means the current skill has a LanceDB binding.
- `info()` and `status()` always exist.
- When LanceDB is not enabled:
  - `enabled = false`
  - `info()` and `status()` return disabled-state descriptions
  - other methods error directly with `current skill has not enabled lancedb`

Stable development constraints:

- Pass one Lua table as `input`.
- Exact business fields and result shapes are defined by the LanceDB provider. LuaSkills only forwards the call and guards capability availability.
- The host/provider also receives stable binding context such as `space_label`, `binding_tag`, and `database_kind`.

### 15.3 Special Note

`vector_search(input)` results may contain two payload forms:

- `data_json`
- `data`

When the result format is JSON, the result table contains `data_json`; otherwise it contains the raw binary string `data`.

For exact input and output fields, combine the host LanceDB provider contract with:

- [Host database provider guide](zh-CN/providers/host-database-provider-guide.md)

## 16. Common Development Guidance

### 16.1 Probe Before Calling

For host-conditionally injected capabilities, probe first:

```lua
if vulcan.sqlite.enabled then
    return vulcan.sqlite.query_json({
        sql = "select 1 as ok",
    })
end

return {
    ok = false,
    reason = "sqlite-disabled",
}
```

### 16.2 Do Not Depend On Internal Field Names

These are internal mechanisms and should not be long-term skill dependencies:

- `vulcan.runtime.internal.*`
- `vulcan.__sqlite_skill_name`
- `vulcan.__lancedb_skill_name`

### 16.3 Do Not Guess Host Directory Layout

Prefer:

- `vulcan.context.skill_dir`
- `vulcan.context.entry_dir`
- `vulcan.context.entry_file`
- `vulcan.deps.*`

Do not infer:

- runtime root directory
- another skill's dependency directory
- whether the host uses a fixed directory name

### 16.4 Distinguish External Request Context From Internal Luaexec Context

If you see the real client name during normal skill execution but see `luaexec_call` inside `vulcan.runtime.lua.exec(...)`, that is expected by design, not a bug.

## 17. Recommended Reading Order

If you mainly write skills, read in this order:

1. This manual: understand the actual current `vulcan.*` capability surface.
2. [README.md](../README.md): understand runtime positioning and host boundaries.
3. [Host database provider guide](zh-CN/providers/host-database-provider-guide.md): understand SQLite / LanceDB host integration contracts.

If you are integrating a host rather than writing a skill, read:

- [FFI integration guide](zh-CN/ffi/integration-guide.md)
- [FFI host checklist](zh-CN/ffi/host-checklist.md)
